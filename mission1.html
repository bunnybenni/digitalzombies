            <h1>Mission One: Basic Survival Skills</h1>
            <p>The mysterious person tells you that rule number one is that you must know your surroundings better than the Digital Zombies do. You're not sure if that's ACTUALLY the most important rule at the time, but then you never inquire as to what order these rules are placed in. They may have just been made up as they go along.</p>
            <p>Your surroundings, in this case, are the University of Oregon Libraries. And there are a LOT of them. The mysterious person tells you that your job is to go find them. ALL of them. Except for the ones that are not located in Eugene. You need to know about their existence, of course, but you don't actually have to visit (unless you REALLY want to, and in that case, go for it!).</p>
