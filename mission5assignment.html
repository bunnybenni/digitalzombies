            <h1>Historical Diaries and Digital Zombies</h1>
            <p>Think about what you did for Mission Four and sketch out how you would write a diary entry about it. Now rewrite it as if your were Martha Ballard, Anne Frank, or Che Guevara (whichever one you picked for your previous task). Your diary entry should be at least 250 words, and it should resemble, in style and in content, the entries of the person you choose to embody.

            <p>The challenge here is that you will not be writing about anything either Martha, Anne, or Che ever wrote about, but you will need to place yourself in their world, their perspective and their writing style.</p>

            <p>Your references to evidence will need to be true to the style of each writer, as will the interpretations of each.</p>
