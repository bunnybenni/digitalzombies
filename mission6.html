            <h1>Mission Six: Mid-Training Period Assessment (Initial Report)</h1>
            <p>The mysterious person takes this opportunity to thank you for your cooperation during the last few weeks. You silently think to yourself, <i>wait,</i> weeks?! <i> How long has this stranger been enlisting me for?!</i></p>
            <p>You realize that the mysterious person is still talking to you and you try to turn your attention back to them. Now that you're roughly halfway through your training, they want you to write a report on how things are going for you in regards to your training and what you've learned so far.</p>
            <p>You breathe a sigh of relief. This assignment may be longer than the others that have been performed so far, but at least it doesn't require any fresh encounters with Digital Zombies! You're just going to be putting the knowledge that you've already gained to use. You can totally do that, right?</p>
