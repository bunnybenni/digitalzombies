            <h1>Write a Letter Back Home</h1>
            <p>Now that you've done your research, the mysterious person would like you to write a letter about it that you can send to someone back home. Your letter should be at least 400 words long. Think about whom you are writing to - you can choose to write to a parent, a friend, or a professor. What tone would you use with the person you are writing to? What aspect of the letter might appeal to them? Think about why you are writing to <i>them</i>.</p>
            <p>Remember to let the reader of your letter know why you chose the painting, where you found it, and where you found the information that helps you explain the painting and its meaning. You need to describe the painting and place it in its artistic, social, political and historical context with some expertise. You also need to articulate how this painting is a primary source, or if it is part of a historical argument, interpretation or analysis.</p>
