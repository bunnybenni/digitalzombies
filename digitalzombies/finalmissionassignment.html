            <h1>The Grand Finale</h1>
            <p>The final presentation of your project is the lie itself – present the evidence, the proof (your fake primary source), and all the supporting material that firmly situates it within a previous version of history.</p>

            <p>Remember – you are not changing history (you are not undoing something that has happened), but you are changing how we understand it and how history will interpret and remember it.</p>

            <p>You have done all the work already in the previous weeks - now is the time to stitch it all together. Digital Zombies won't be able to tell it's a lie - but even a few un-infected might be fooled into believing it (including the mysterious person)!</p>

            <p>You can present your lie in a myriad of ways, you can integrate video or music and images – but you will always need to write at least 1500 words, not including the primary source.</p>
