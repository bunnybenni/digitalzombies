            <h1>Fabricating Your Evidence</h1>
            <p>This is smoking gun! The evidence that overturns everything we thought we knew! It doesn't have to be that radical - you can find a piece of evidence that people have never been able to unearth (like the Ark of the Covenant that Indiana Jones was looking for), but it might be easier to locate a missing map (or scrap of a map), a long diary your grandmother kept in her attic, or using technology - you may be able to find a detail in a photograph that had not been developed (on a pre-digital roll of film), let your imagination roam to think about possible evidence. This, again, rules out aliens and the supernatural.</p>
            <p>You need to physically make the source, since you will need to present this in your final report. You need to make the fake evidence, and share a digital image/file of it in your submission.</p>
