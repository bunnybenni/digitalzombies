            <p>The mysterious person disappears. You think it might have had something to do with that lie you gave them -- apparently you were so convincing that it scared them out of town. You don't know if you feel sad or relieved. You kind of miss having them around.</p>
            <p>You take a look around you, and you see a few Digital Zombies walking by. You also identify a few Digital Citizens. You give a smile and a friendly wave, and they return the gesture. It's nice seeing some friendly faces.</p>
            <p>Now feeling confident, you start walking toward the bike path so you can get back home. You're not sure when exactly the last time you went back home was (or the last time you slept, for that matter...), but you're excited to go home feeling wiser and more prepared for the world.</p>
            <p>After all, you are no longer in danger of joining the ranks of those Digital Zombies on the bike path. Bring them on.</p>
            <h1>Congratulations -- You Are Now A Digital Citizen. Digital Zombies, Beware!</a></h1>
