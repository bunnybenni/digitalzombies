            <p>You've been paired off with another non-Digital Zombie who looks equally confused. The mysterious being has instructed you to share your lies with each other -- are you able to convince the other person of your lie?</p>
            <p>This task doesn't require you to turn anything in, but it would be wise to make the most of it -- if you can't get the random person sitting in front of you to believe you, then how are you supposed to fool the mysterious person?</p>
            <p>The more feedback you take in and give out, the stronger your lies are going to be for it. It would be wise to take notes on what the other person says about your lies. What would make them believe?</p>
