            <h1>Mission Eight: Lie To Me -- The (Fake) Evidence</h1>
            <p>You've done your research, and you've managed to keep the mysterious person pleased. At this point, you can't really tell if they're actually pleased or if that's just their face. It could be either, really.</p>
            <p>Now the mysterious person tells you that it's time to get crafty. You're immediately suspicious, and you ask for clarification.</p>
            <p>It's simple, the mysterious person says -- you just need to create the fake evidence that is going to support your historical lies. And you need to make people believe it.</p>
            <p>You're a little worried about how "realistic" you can possibly make fake evidence, but the mysterious person tells you not to worry. They've got a plan to help you out, after all.</p>
