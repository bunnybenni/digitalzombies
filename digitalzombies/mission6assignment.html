            <h1>Training Assessment</h1>
            <p>Your initial report is a mid-training assessment of lessons learnt so far. This is good opportunity to demonstrate that you have learnt from past mistakes, and are now ready to take on more challenging tasks in the fight against Digital Zombies/Zombie-ism.</p>

            <p>Your report is a two-part essay of at least 1000 words. The report should be written in a formal paper style, and should cover the following questions - these are, however, not exclusive, so if you have more to say, please do.</p>

            <p><strong>Part 1.</strong> What is the state of the digital zombie outbreak: use the following questions as guides. You need to at least be able to answer this, but feel free to go beyond.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From your perspective and based on what you know by now, what is a Digital Zombie?</li>
                <li>How do you know YOU are not a Digital Zombie?</li>
                <li>What do you know now that you did not know at the beginning of this class?</li>
                <li>Comment on the state of the Digital Zombie outbreak, what does the future look like - on campus and beyond?</li>
                <li>Based on your experience over the last 5 weeks, write-up at least 5 tips/ dos & don'ts for any student who wants/needs to do research.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Part 2:</strong> WWZ and DZ</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The course so far has introduced you to a series of primary sources. Find at least two types of primary sources in WWZ and explain how Max Brooks uses them in his narrative.</li>
                <li>Now that you know libraries and librarians pretty well, what aspect of the WWZ story could Max Brooks have developed more? How would he do that - tell us what books/references he could use and why.</li>
                <li>Check Wikipedia for articles on World War Z and Max Brooks. Summarize the information available about the author and his book - is it well documented, well written, well footnoted?</li>
            </ul>
