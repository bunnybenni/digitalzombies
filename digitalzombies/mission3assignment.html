            <p>Once again, the mysterious person is pleased by your efforts. They hand you a cookie and tell you that it's vegan and gluten free. You really want to eat the cookie, but you're a little off-put by the odd source it came from. (See? You're already thinking more critically about sources!)</p>
            <p>The mysterious person now wants you to write a report about the outbreak you researched. You silently wonder what this person does with all of the work they're collecting from you.</p>
            <p>In at least 500 words, explain what disease you researched and what lead you to choosing this disease above others. Follow up by explaining how these digital resources helped you understand the disease better. Youâ€™ll need to reference the works you read, and tell us where you found them.</p>
