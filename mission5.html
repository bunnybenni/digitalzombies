            <h1>Mission Five: Diary Entries From History</h1>
            <p>The mysterious person thanks you for your efforts. It couldn't have been easy walking into the lion's den like that! Now they want you to try learning from people who are no longer living. You begin to sweat before the mysterious person clarifies that you're not going to be learning from the <i>undead</i> -- you'll be learning from people who have passed on in earlier centuries. More specifically, you'll be reading their diaries.</p>
            <p>You're skeptical about this assignment, but you're going to give it a go anyway. After all, you really like learning about people's lives -- why not learn about their lives from them themselves?</p>
