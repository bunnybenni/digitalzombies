        <h2>From this Adaptation of the Project</h2>
        <h3>Benni: semi-professional nerd</h3>
        <p>email: <a href="mailto:benni2@uw.edu">benni2@uw.edu</a></p>
        <p>Benni is a Master of Library and Information Science student at the University of Washington. They adapted this project for the class LIS 529: Digital Humanities Librarianship, attempting to make the project feel more interactive while adapting it to the collections of the University of Oregon Libraries (where they work). Benni lives with their tuxedo cat, Coco, in Springfield, Oregon. The design of this website was largely taken from a website that Benni made for Coco in a previous term. Picture this website as it is, only all of the photos on the site are of fluffy kittens -- that's what it looked like while they were working on this project. Having fun yet?</p>
