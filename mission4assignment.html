            <p>In at least 250 words, assess the validity of the Wikipedia articles that cover the painting you researched during Mission Two. How do you know the Wikipedia articles are reliable? Make sure you cite the Wikipedia articles you are looking at (you can do this easily by looking under "tools" in the left hand navigation bar of the Wikipedia article and then clicking "cite this page").</p>

            <p>What does wikipedia say about it? About its author? About its meaning?</p>
            <p>If Wikipedia were the only form of information available would it have been enough ? How does Wikipedia cover this subject you now know a lot about? Is it reliable information, and if so, how can you tell?</p>
            <p>(Hint: have you tried clicking on the "Talk" or "History" tabs at the top of the Wikipedia page you're looking at?)</p>
