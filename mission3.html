            <h1>Mission Three: Digital Zombie On The Web</h1>
            <p>The mysterious person praises you for your work during that last mission. See, you totally needed that librarian!</p>
            <p>Now the mysterious person wants you to try to do some research on your own -- and you're going to be researching outbreaks. Using the Internet. You feel a little nervous. Isn't that how this all got started?</p>
            <p>The mysterious person tells you not to worry -- you're going to learn how to search some reliable parts of the Internet, including sources that come from the UO Libraries website. Also, they tell you that researching outbreaks is for the best -- what better way to protect yourself than to learn about the threat itself?</p>
            <p>(You think of a couple things off the top of your head, like keeping your distance from the infected, but you keep your mouth shut.)</p>
