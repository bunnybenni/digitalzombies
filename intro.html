            <p>It's a warm day outside. You're taking a walk on the bike path along the river, your nose stuck in Max Brooks' <i>World War Z.</i> Every once in a while a bicycle or a runner goes past you, and you let them pass without even looking up. You're just getting to the end of the book, and you really REALLY want to finish it.</p>
            <p>You shut the book after reading the last sentence and smile to yourself, looking off into the distance. Then your smile slowly begins to fade as you see what's going on around you.</p>
            <p>You see people on their phones.</p>
            <p>You see them pointing to their devices and talking about news articles.</p>
            <p>You see that none of them are checking their sources.</p>
            <p>You have just run into a horde of Digital Zombies.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, someone yanks on your arm and you get shoved into the back of a moving vehicle. You're suspicious, but you go with it because you're certain a Digital Zombie couldn't have pulled that off. That would require looking up from their phones.</p>
            <p>The vehicle stops, and you're allowed to exit. You find yourself in a University of Oregon parking lot -- they must be staff if they're parking. Parking without a staff pass is nearly impossible.</p>
            <p>A mysterious person warns you about the dangers of Digital Zombies, and wants to help you learn how to protect yourself through a series of tasks. You think about it for a moment, and then you accept. You don't want to become a Digital Zombie, too!</p>
