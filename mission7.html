            <h1>Mission Seven: Lie To Me -- A Practical Application Of The Training Modules</h1>
            <p>You've gotten through you're mid-training report, and the mysterious person, again, seems pleased. You start to wonder what it would take to displease the mysterious person. You suspect that it might have something to do with their students (which you guess you are) becoming Digital Zombies, and you do <i>not</i> want to find out.</p>
            <p>The mysterious person tells you that your next mission is actually going to be broken down into several missions over the last few weeks of training. They liken it to a "final project" at the end of a university course. You think that sounds suspicious, but you play along.</p>
            <p>Your "final project" of sorts has one goal -- you have to lie to the mysterious person. And you need to make it convincing.</p>
            <p>The mysterious person tells you this is very important -- the Digital Zombies are getting close, and you need to understand how to "blend in" with them in order to protect yourself. The characters on <i>The Walking Dead</i> disguised themselves by draping zombie parts all over their bodies (though everyone knows that those aren't <i>real</i> zombies -- pfft), so you should be able to blend in by learning to mimic Digital Zombie behavior!</p>
            <p>Your brain starts to swirl with all sorts of ideas on how to do this, but you're not really sure where to start. The mysterious person tells you not to worry, though, because they're going to walk you through all the steps you need to take to tell a good, convincing lie.</p>
